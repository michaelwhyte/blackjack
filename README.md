HTML/CSS/JS Blackjack game

This game is based on ideas and techniques I learned from doing part of Codeacademy's Blackjack: Deal 'em Up JavaScript course. See the link to the course below.

Other inspiration for this Blackjack game came from a blackjack JavaScript example I found on the web. See the link below for the blackjack JavaScript.
